"黑白棋是19世紀末英國人發明的。直到上個世紀70年代日本人長谷川五郎將其發展，借用莎士比亞名劇奧賽羅為這個遊戲重新命名。\n\n\n奧賽羅是一個黑人，妻子是白人，因受小人挑撥，懷疑妻子不忠一直情海翻波，最終親手把妻子殺死。後來真相大白，奧賽羅懊悔不已，自殺而死。黑白棋就是借用這個黑人白人鬥爭的故事。" = "Othello was invented by the British at the end of the 19th century.

He was provoked by the villain and suspected of his wife's unfaithfulness. He eventually killed his wife personally. After the truth came to light, Othello repented and committed suicide.
